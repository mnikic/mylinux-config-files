These are some of my file needed to make a working i3 destop on arch. Tested on Arch installed in August 2023.

Not all of the i3 blocklets that are there are used actually, and there is a c compiled file cpu_usage2 that is executable but doesn't have an extension so i didn't know how to exclude it.
There is also a minor issue with the volume icon in the tray when the system is starting (not sure why yet).
So yeah, work in progress.

If on arch i believe that invoking:

sudo sh install-arch.sh

will do everything needed.
Then restart i3 (win+shift+r) or just log out and in again.
And that should be it.
